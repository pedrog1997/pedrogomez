      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Most of us choose a career in the most boring way, we
        analyze our own strengths, the market, our preferences,
        etc. I chose to be a software developer not because there
        are good market opportunities, but rather because I love
        it! It gives you the power to create things from nothing,
        and the opportunity to test your logical abilities and
        creativity solving problems.

      <h2>Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        I am an enthusiastic team member, with strong
        logical and mathematical abilities who loves to solve
        complex problems.

      <h2>Skills to Improve</h2>
      <p>
        I need to improve on my adaptability skills, I
        always prefer having all the information at my
        disposal before starting my task, but sometimes
        you have to adapt and learn in the process to
        deliver on time.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="extras">
      <p>
        <strong>I work best when</strong> the task I am tackling
        is challenging and requires me to come up
        with a creative solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I want most in my next job</strong> is to 
        enrich my knowledge working on intellectual
        challenges with a good team in a relaxed
        but effective environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The biggest motivation for me</strong> is
        working on an inspiring project that will
        have real impact in the company.
