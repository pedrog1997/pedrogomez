      <h2>Web Application Project</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>S: </strong>We had to develop a web application to automatize the admission
        process for new students at <a href="https://www.greenfoxacademy.com/en/home">Green Fox Academy</a>
        . The application had several stages including a video interview and DRT test. The user
        could see where he was in the admission process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>T: </strong>My role as a developer apart from completing the user stories was to
        create, organize, and merge all individual branches to the development branch. For each user
        story completed I had to create the corresponding test.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A: </strong>We followed SCRUM methodology with a team of 7 developers (including me of course!),
        one SCRUM master, and one product owner. For the video interview Indivizo API was used, and for the
        DRT an external link. Frontend was done with Javascript, haml and scss; backend with Ruby on Rails
        , and to manage the databases we used MySQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were so many branches and merges I soon was called the "Git master."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>R: </strong> The result was overwhelming, the application was incredible for the little time
        we had worked on it (2 months). So good that it is the actual application that Green Fox Academy
        uses for the new student.

      <h2>Augmented Reality Project</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>S: </strong> Frisa, an industrial rolled rings manufacturer, had a little problem
        with the precision of one of the measurements they had to do. It was a small part
        of the ring, about 3mm, and they used the old style Verniers (because the digital
        ones were too fragile to be used in that environment). In order to solve that problem
        my team and I had to come up with an innovative solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>T: </strong>We decided to create a augmented reality tutorial on the best way to use 
        the Vernier.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A: </strong>My role in this project was to do all the 3d modelling of the ring and
        measurement tools and create the animations that were going to be used in the tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Siemens NX was used for the 3d modelling and Blender to make the animations. For the augmented reality
        tutorial, we used Unity and a tool called Vuforia. Everything was programmed in C#.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>R: </strong>Frisa was more than happy with the results, they even admitted they were
        not expecting much. But the tutorial was such high quality Frisa had to take its hat off.
