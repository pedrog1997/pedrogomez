    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I grew up in a small town called Montemorelos in the State of Nuevo León
      in México. It is a beautiful town known for its delicious oranges. In the best
      times of Montemorelos we would export organes all the way to Germany.

      I studied all elementary school and junior highschool in my town before moving
      to the big city of Monterrey to attend University. Now I can proudly say that I study in the
      best university of all Mexico, <strong>Tecnológico de Monterrey</strong>. I study the
      sixth semester (out of 9) of <strong>Digital Systems and Robotics Engineering</strong>.

      <h2>International Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        In my second year of highschool I went to study abroad, <strong>Budapest, Hungary</strong>,
        beautiful city, with a parliament that was done a few meters larger than the English Parliament
        in purpose, beautiful castles and forests. In Budapest I studied piano in a music academy
        where I strengthened my love for <strong>classical music</strong>.

        The summer of 2016, I took two business related classes in the University of Burgos. A magical
        town known for <strong>"El camino de Santiago"</strong>, there I learned about business intelligence
        and marketing, while admiring the roman and gothic architecture of buildings that were built 
        before my loved country was even in the World Map.

        Last semester, January - May 2018, I was certified as a <a href="/">Junior Software Developer</a>
        by the <a href="https://www.greenfoxacademy.com/en/home">Green Fox Academy</a> when I 
        successfully completed a 4 months long coding bootcamp in Budapest, Hungary. During that time
        I worked on developing the web application that automatized the admission process for the new 
        students at the academy.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        As I mentioned above, I <strong>love</strong> playing the piano. I have been playing since
        I was 5 years old, and I even went to Budapest in highschool to play. I has become a part of me
        as my love for technology and programming. "Thanks" to the university I have less and less time
        to practice but I will never leave it.
